To use the cleaning template:

1) Paste the summary output from Andy's script for each subject (you can use the concantenation script to 
combine the summary file for each subject into one file) into the Raw Data tab of the template.

2) Remove manually identified bad channels (identified using EDF Browser visual inspection) by entering a "1" 
for the appropriate subject and channel (green section) of the Quality Metrics tab.

3) Use the output on the Final_Data tab for subsaquent analyses.
