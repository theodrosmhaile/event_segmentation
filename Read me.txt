Before using the eeg.analysis script, first ensure that your directory structure is correct. You should create 
a seperate subject folder named with the subjects number (i.e. 28211) for each subject. Each subject folder should contain
the corresponding raw datas (i.e. 28211_ClosedPre1) file. All data files should be named in the following way 
Subj#_[WhateverYouWant]1.txt. If the number at the end of your file is a 1 your subject folder should only include 
one subject file, if the number is a 2 your folder should contain 2 files (i.e. 28211_ClosedPre1 and 28211_ClosedPre2) 
in this case only the second file (28211_ClosedPre2) will be analyzed.

The analysis script should be in the same dirctory where all of your subject folders are contained.

Once your folders are set up correctly and your files are named correctly. Open the analysis script in R Studio.
On the command line type source('eeg.analysis.3.1.3.txt') and then enter. Then type analyze.folders("ClosedPre") and then enter.
You can run multiple subjects at once as long as the directories are set up and the files are named correctly.
